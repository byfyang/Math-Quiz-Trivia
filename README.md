# Math-Quiz-Trivia


This is a simple Math Quiz Trivia game. I created this game with a set list of math questions (it can be expanded or I can find an API with math questions - it's a pain to make your own). 

Technologies used: I used html, javascript, a little bit of jquery to make and play the game. The design is simple and straightforward. 

I based this game off of early browser games I used to play as a kid. The targeted audience in my mind is around 10 years old? However, given the toys and whistles kids now have these days, this is slightly antiquated. 

Rules of the Game:
Just play the game - Two buttons, one timer, simple enough...I think you'll do alright ^.^V
